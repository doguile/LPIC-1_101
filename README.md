# üêß 101-500

Hi folks:smile:

As the same way while I was studying for my LPIC-101-500 certification also I was taking notes of the material, so I have created this gitbook to have a handy help resource to prepare for the exam.

Hope this will help you in your process of studying for the certification and achive the goal !

See ya!
