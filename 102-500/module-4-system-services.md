`/etc/chrony.conf` The configuration file that controls chronyd

`/etc/ntp.conf` The configuration file for setting up the ntpd daemon as either an NTP client or server. The NTP package provides a default configuration which makes the system behave as a NTP client.

`chronyc`  the chronyc program is used to interface with chronyd via the command line

`hwclock` Command used by the root user to update and query the hardware clock

`ntpd` The NTP daemon that sets and updates the system time in synchronization with one or more reference time servers. This daemon sends messages to and receives messages from preconfigured servers at certain intervals.

`pool.ntp.org` The pool.ntp.org domain is a virtual cluster of time servers providing NTP service to system across the globe. The default entries in the `/etc/ntp.conf` file refer to a set of servers which are randomly updated every hour.

`timedatectl` System using systemd as their init-system use the timedatectl command to view and control time on the system. Running the timedatectl command without any arguments shows the current time and the time settings for the system

## Introduction

Managing system services is one of the primary job functions of a system administrator. There are a large number of services that a system can be configured to provide, including web services, file-sharing services, and authentication services.

This module will focus on four major services:

* System time: maintains accurate time used by system services and events
* Logging: records errors, warnings, and messages generated by the kernel and programs.
* Email: enables system users to send and receive email.
* Printer: manages the queing, tracking and filtering of user print jobs.

Almost every activity on the server needs to be aware of the system time.

## Understanding the Clock

Linux-based systems have two types of clocks:

* **System Clock**: This is a clock maintained by the kernel and is _interrupt-driven_. **The value of this clock is initialized from the hardware clock at boot time**. The system time is calculated as the number of seconds since `January 1st 1970 00:00:00` (This reference time is known as epoch time or sometimes UNIX time). The system clock contains the current time as well as time zone information.
* **Hardware** **Clock**: This is a battery-powered clock that keeps time even when the system is shut down. When the system boots, the system clock is set using the hardware clock. When the system is shut down, the hardware clock is set to the value of the system clock. This ensures that both the clocks are synchronized.
